## Acknowledgments

* Thanks to the [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) team, obviously, without such a beautiful yet practical language, this backend would not exist
* Thanks to [ninja-build](https://ninja-build.org), ReScript also comes with a blazing fast build tool on top of it, `ninja` is a truly [well engineered](http://aosabook.org/en/posa/ninja.html) scalable build tool
